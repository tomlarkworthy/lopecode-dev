{"id":"lopecode-dev-2cj","title":"Add persistent Playwright session with REPL interface","description":"Starting Playwright from scratch for each test run is expensive (~5-10s overhead). Implement a persistent browser session approach:\n\n1. **Server mode**: lope-runner.js --server starts a long-running process with browser open\n2. **REPL interface**: Accept commands via stdin/socket to:\n   - Load/reload notebooks\n   - Run tests\n   - Execute arbitrary JS in page context\n   - Query cell values\n3. **Benefits**:\n   - Fast iteration (\u003c1s for test runs after initial load)\n   - Interactive debugging\n   - Could integrate with editor/IDE\n\nPossible approaches:\n- Simple stdin/stdout JSON-RPC\n- Unix socket for programmatic access\n- WebSocket for remote/IDE integration\n\nRelated: This would enable watch mode for TDD workflows.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tom.larkworthy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T13:58:24.184673+01:00","created_by":"Tom Larkworthy","updated_at":"2026-01-20T14:02:01.557642+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T14:02:01.557642+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented lope-repl.js with persistent Playwright session.

{"id":"lopecode-dev-syz","title":"Add cell patching workflow for agent-assisted edits","description":"Since re-exporting notebooks is a browser-driven process, agents need a workflow for preparing cell changes that humans can apply.
