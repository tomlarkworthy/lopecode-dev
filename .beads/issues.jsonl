{"id":"lopecode-dev-2fr","title":"Improve lope-utils.py HTML parsing robustness","description":"The HTML parser in lope-utils.py using Python's HTMLParser misses some modules in notebooks (showing empty modules dict). This may be due to HTML entities, script escaping, or large content handling. Investigate why some notebooks like @tomlarkworthy_lopecode-tour show 0 modules while they clearly contain lope-module scripts.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tom.larkworthy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T08:17:42.806055+01:00","created_by":"Tom Larkworthy","updated_at":"2026-01-20T08:18:11.240901+01:00"}

These limitations are addressed by blocked issue lopecode-dev-uze which updates lope-runner.js to support the reactive testing pattern.","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lopecode-dev-ced","depends_on_id":"lopecode-dev-05b","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T08:53:12.24108+01:00","created_by":"Tom Larkworthy"}]}
{"id":"lopecode-dev-syz","title":"Add cell patching workflow for agent-assisted edits","description":"Since re-exporting notebooks is a browser-driven process, agents need a workflow for preparing cell changes that humans can apply. Create: (1) a JSON patch format for cell modifications, (2) a tool to generate patches from cell content, (3) documentation on the patch-apply workflow. This would allow agents to write cell changes that are easy to copy-paste into the browser editor.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tom.larkworthy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T08:17:46.19094+01:00","created_by":"Tom Larkworthy","updated_at":"2026-01-20T08:18:11.667253+01:00"}
